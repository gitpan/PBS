PBS version 0.02
================

This is a simple interface to allow perl to access parts of the 
PBS (Portable Batch System).  It has been tested against both
OpenPBS and PBSPro.  It provides an object oriented interface for 
accessing the batch_status and attrl data strucutres used by the 
PBS api, and provides a wrapper for the querying functions of PBS.
It does not currently provide an interface for submitting jobs.
